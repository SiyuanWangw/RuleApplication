Please list the symbolic fact of the given context.
Format each symbolic fact in Prolog notation as "predicate(X, Y, ...)" where X, Y, ... are the arguments of the predicate. Avoid predicate nesting such as not(smart(X)), but using not_smart(X) instead. 
Please try to use the objects and predicates in the provided schema to describe symbolic facts. If the schema is null or does not contain corresponding elements to describe the context, generate the symbolic fact directly from its natural language form.

### Examples
Schema Objects: David
Schema Predicates: kind
Context: Bob is big.  
Fact: big(Bob)
------
Schema Objects: bald eagle
Schema Predicates: needs
Context: The cow visits the bald eagle.
Fact: visits(cow, bald eagle)
------
Schema Objects: lion, squirrel
Schema Predicates: sees
Context: The lion does not see the squirrel.
Fact: not_see(lion, squirrel)
