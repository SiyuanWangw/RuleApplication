You will receive a context including a list of constraint rules, and a specific query with five candidate options (A, B, C, D, E).
Please list the symbolic forms of all established facts in the given query and option. 
Format each symbolic fact in Prolog notation as "predicate(X, Y, ...)" where X, Y, ... are the arguments of the predicate. 
Please try to use the objects and predicates in the provided schema to describe symbolic facts. If the schema is null or does not contain corresponding elements to describe the context, generate the symbolic fact directly from its natural language form. Please always use one predicate, i.e., assign.

### Examples: 
Schema Objects: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, morning 
Schema Predicates: assign
