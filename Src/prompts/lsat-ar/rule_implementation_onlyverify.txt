At each turn, you will be provided a context background, a constraint rule, a query and an option fact. 
Please on a new line starting with "Rule Implementation:" to implement the rule based on the option fact to analyze there is a conflict between them.
Then predict "Yes" or "No" to judge whether there is a conflict between the rule and facts, in a new line starting with "Judgement:".
