 "Which one of the following is an allowable way of designating subzones within the three zones? Millville has created three new development zones: Z1, Z2, and Z3. Within these zones, subzones can be designated for housing, industrial, or retail use, with no subzone designated for more than one use. By city regulation, a total of no more than three subzones can be designated for each of the three uses. The following restrictions are in place: Retail subzones are not allowed in Z1. No more than two subzones for housing are allowed in any particular zone. No more than one retail subzone is allowed in any zone in which a subzone is designated for housing. Industrial subzones are not allowed in any zone in which a subzone is designated for housing or three subzones are designated for retail use.": "Analysis: \n1. Retail subzones are not allowed in Z1, so any option with retail subzones in Z1 is incorrect.\n2. No more than two subzones for housing are allowed in any particular zone, which means Z2 and Z3 can have at most two housing subzones.\n3. No more than one retail subzone is allowed in any zone with a housing subzone, eliminating options with more than one retail subzone in a zone with housing.\n4. Industrial subzones are not allowed in zones with housing subzones or three retail subzones, which restricts the placement of industrial subzones.\n5. Considering the above rules, we need to find an option that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nOption A violates the rule of having no retail subzones in Z1. Option B has more than one retail subzone in a zone with housing, violating the constraint. Option C also has more than one retail subzone in a zone with housing, making it invalid. Option D has three retail subzones in Z3, which is not allowed. \n\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies all the constraints is Option E, where Z1 has one industrial subzone, Z2 has two housing subzones and one retail subzone, and Z3 has one industrial subzone and two retail subzones.\n\nAnswer: E\n#END#",
